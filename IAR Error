startup_stm32l496xx.s 

Error[438]: This instruction is not available in the selected cpu/core F:\Work\STM32L496ZGTxP2\EWARM\startup_stm32l496xx.s 189 

I also faced similar problem but for another controller.
The problem was with wrong setting of core. It worked after selecting proper controller.
This you can find under Project ->Options->General Options->Target
You can check what core(in your case it will be Cortex-M4 core) or device selected(STM32L496ZG).
